# Heart-Disease-Prediction

-> Project Objective: <br>
Heart disease is one of the most prevelant disease in the world. Early prediction system can avert the fatalities caused by the same. 
This project is one small initiative, where a prediction system is built using Tensorflow framework. <br>

-> Algorithms used: <br>
(1) Deep Neural Network (DNN) Classifier <br>
(2) Logistic Regression <br>

-> Libraries used: <br>
(1) Pandas <br>
(2) Tensorflow <br>
(3) Scikit-Learn <br>
(4) Matplotlib <br>
(5) Seaborn
