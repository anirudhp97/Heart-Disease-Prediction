# Heart-Disease-Prediction

-> Project Objective: <br>
Heart disease is one of the most prevelant disease in the world. Early prediction system can avert the fatalities caused by the same. 
This project is one small initiative, where a prediction system is built using Tensorflow framework.

-> Algorithms used:
(1) Deep Neural Network (DNN) classifier
(2) Logistic Regression

-> Libraries used:
(1) Pandas
(2) Numpy
(3) Tensorflow
(4) Scikit-Learn
(5) Matplotlib
(6) Seaborn
